### Xamarin.Android Staggered Grid View, with Infinite Scrolling example

I did a blog post about this one at [http://blog.wislon.io/posts/2015/03/05/xamarin-android-staggered-grid-layout/](http://blog.wislon.io/posts/2015/03/05/xamarin-android-staggered-grid-layout/)

Switch to the `add-viewholder` [branch](https://github.com/wislon/xam-gridview-infinite-scroll/tree/add-viewholder) to see the viewholder performance improvement code, as well as a link to my corresponding blog post.

Switch to the `master` branch to see the original app (and link to corresponding article) about how to build a `GridView` with infinite scrolling, in Xamarin.
