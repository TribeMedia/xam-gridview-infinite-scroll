### Xamarin.Android Gridview with Infinite Scrolling Example

I did a blog post about this one at [http://blog.wislon.io/posts/2015/01/27/xamarin-android-gridview-with-infinite-scrolling](http://blog.wislon.io/posts/2015/01/27/xamarin-android-gridview-with-infinite-scrolling)

Switch to the `add-viewholder` [branch](https://github.com/wislon/xam-gridview-infinite-scroll/tree/add-viewholder) to see the viewholder performance improvement code, as well as a link to my corresponding blog post.
