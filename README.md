### Improving Gridview Recycle/Scrolling performance. 

I did a blog post about this one at [http://blog.wislon.io/posts/2015/02/21/xamarin-android-gridview-improve-performance](http://blog.wislon.io/posts/2015/02/21/xamarin-android-gridview-improve-performance).

Switch to the `staggered-grid` branch to see the implementation of a staggered grid layout, as well as a link to my corresponding blog post.

Switch to the `master` branch to see the original app (and link to corresponding article) about how to build a GridView with infinite scrolling, in Xamarin.
